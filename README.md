## Usage

### Managing Players
1. Click "Manage Players" to open the database modal
2. Add new players with name, gender, and skill level
3. Import players via CSV (columns: name, gender, level)
4. Export player database to CSV

### Using the Player Pool
1. Add players to the pool from the database modal
2. Search and filter players by level
3. Remove players from pool using the X button

### Creating Matches
1. Click "Create Match" to start a new match
2. Select a match and click players to add them
3. Use "Smart Match" to auto-fill based on wait time and skill
4. Move completed matches to available courts

### Managing Courts
1. Add new courts with custom names
2. Rename or delete courts as needed
3. End active matches to return players to pool

## Smart Match Algorithm

The Smart Match feature selects players with the following priority:

1. **Longest Idle Time**: Players waiting longest are prioritized first
2. **Expert Exclusivity**: Expert players can ONLY be grouped with other Expert players
3. **Mixed Skill Levels**: For non-Expert matches, the algorithm prefers mixing Advanced, Intermediate, and Novice players together
4. **Gender Balance**: Tries to create balanced groups with equal male and female players (e.g., 2M + 2F)
5. **Skill Level Balance**: Uses smart selection to ensure an even distribution of skill levels
6. **Incomplete Expert Matches**: If there aren't enough Expert players available, the remaining slots are left empty

### How it works:

The algorithm evaluates each available player and calculates a "balance score" based on:
- How underrepresented their gender is in the current match
- How underrepresented their skill level is in the current match  
- How long they've been waiting

Players who would best balance the group are selected first.

### Example Scenarios:

- **Empty match, pool has**: 2M-Adv, 1F-Adv, 2M-Int, 2F-Int, 1M-Nov
  - Selects: 1F-Adv → 1M-Int → 1F-Int → 1M-Nov (balanced gender and mixed levels)
  
- **Expert with longest wait time**:
  - Only selects other Expert players, balances gender among experts
  - Leaves slots empty if not enough experts

- **Match already has 2 males**:
  - Next picks prioritize female players to balance gender

## CSV Format

For importing players, use this CSV format:
```
name,gender,level
John Doe,male,Advanced
Jane Smith,female,Expert
```

- **name** (required): Player name
- **gender** (optional): male/female (default: male)
- **level** (optional): Expert/Advanced/Intermediate/Novice (default: Intermediate)

## Technologies

- React 18
- Tailwind CSS 3

## Data Persistence

All application data is automatically saved to your browser's localStorage:

- **baddixx_players**: Player database
- **baddixx_pool**: Current player pool
- **baddixx_matches**: Queued matches
- **baddixx_courts**: Court configurations and active matches

Data persists across browser refreshes and sessions. Use the **Reset** button in the header to clear all saved data and restore defaults.
